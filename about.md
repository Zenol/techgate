### Hi. I'm Jeremy.

Hello, my name is *Jeremy Cochoy*.
I am a doctor in mathematics and Computer Science.
I am french, I live in Paris and yes I eat frogs and snails with perslay and garlic.

I put TechGate online as a collection of blog posts, slides and talk, and divers tutorials
that may benefit geeks all around the universe. ðŸ˜ƒ

During my PhD my [research](http://zenol.fr/reaserch/) was on Bidimensional Persistence Modules.
